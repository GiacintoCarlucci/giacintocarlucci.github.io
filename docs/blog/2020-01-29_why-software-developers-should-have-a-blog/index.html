    <h2 id="one-step-away-from-being-ahead.">One step away from being ahead.</h2>
    <p>As a software developer sometimes I need to look myself at the mirror and ask: <strong>‘What do I need to improve?’</strong></p>
    <p>Having a pile of projects in your personal library does not improve your skills, it just gives you a chance to be convinced that you are a skilled developer and that everyone should agree with your point of view.</p>
    <p>One thing I noticed in these years is that if you can not see what you have built, then you can not grow, and <strong>if you are not growing, you are wasting time.</strong></p>
    <p>So, what is the point? I was searching for something that created a story for me. Something that could tell me what (and how) I have been doing through days, months and years. <strong>I needed to have a personal blog.<br />
    </strong> This brings some useful advantages:</p>
    <h3 id="look-back">Look back</h3>
    <p>The opportunity <strong>to analyze and see what is your way to do things and how it evolves in time</strong> is a priceless gift to do to yourself, and <strong>confronting your work with the community</strong> is what I call a killer-combo for growth.</p>
    <h3 id="a-better-way-to-learn">A better way to learn</h3>
    <p>Another bonus that comes with that is that you <strong>learn much faster</strong> when you have to explain a topic and <strong>writing a blog post or even a tutorial challenges you.</strong> You can only explain something if you deeply understand what you are talking about.</p>
    <h3 id="what-you-teach-wont-be-forgotten-so-fast">What you teach won’t be forgotten so fast</h3>
    <p>Let’s be honest, copying and pasting code from stackoverflow is not a great way to remember how you solved a problem. <strong>If you teach what you learned you will remember</strong> what kind of solution you adopted and why.</p>
    <h3 id="you-can-help-people-for-free">You can help people for free</h3>
    <p>In 2020 you can share almost everything via the internet, but the most valuable thing is information. <strong>Helping people find a way to learn something</strong> <strong>is great</strong>, just think about how many times you searched for something and there was someone out there that already solved the issue for you. <strong>Plus, it’s free.</strong></p>
    <h3 id="build-your-career">Build your career</h3>
    <p>Blogging as a software developer is awesome, you can create any sort of connection, from awesome developers to good job contracts. Just keep your standards as high as possible, <strong>someone will notice you</strong> for sure.</p>
