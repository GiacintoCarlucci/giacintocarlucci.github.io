# Why Software Developers should have a blog
## One step away from being ahead.

As a software developer sometimes I need to look myself at the mirror and ask:
**‘What do I need to improve?’**

Having a pile of projects in your personal library does not improve your
skills, it just gives you a chance to be convinced that you are a skilled
developer and that everyone should agree with your point of view.

One thing I noticed in these years is that if you can not see what you have
built, then you can not grow, and **if you are not growing, you are wasting
time.**

So, what is the point? I was searching for something that created a story for
me. Something that could tell me what (and how) I have been doing through
days, months and years. **I needed to have a personal blog.  
** This brings some useful advantages:

### Look back

The opportunity **to analyze and see what is your way to do things and how it
evolves in time** is a priceless gift to do to yourself, and **confronting
your work with the community** is what I call a killer-combo for growth.

### A better way to learn

Another bonus that comes with that is that you **learn much faster** when you
have to explain a topic and **writing a blog post or even a tutorial
challenges you.** You can only explain something if you deeply understand what
you are talking about.

### What you teach won’t be forgotten so fast

Let’s be honest, copying and pasting code from stackoverflow is not a great
way to remember how you solved a problem. **If you teach what you learned you
will remember** what kind of solution you adopted and why.

### You can help people for free

In 2020 you can share almost everything via the internet, but the most
valuable thing is information. **Helping people find a way to learn
something** **is great**, just think about how many times you searched for
something and there was someone out there that already solved the issue for
you. **Plus, it’s free.**

### Build your career

Blogging as a software developer is awesome, you can create any sort of
connection, from awesome developers to good job contracts. Just keep your
standards as high as possible, **someone will notice you** for sure.
