    <h1 id="about">About</h1>
    <p>Hi! I’m Giacinto, a curious guy born in 1996 and living in Italy. I’m in love with the idea of ​​being able to create virtually anything from scratch with just a computer since I was a kid.</p>
    <p>I started programming in C language (Someone will say the worst way to start, someone else will say the best …) at 13, when my dad bought me an Intel Core Duo powered desktop from a shop whose owner is a man who has repaired my computer many times, because I couldn’t help but open it up and try to figure out how a computer works.</p>
    <p>Later, that man became my computer science teacher in high school, making me fall in love with the subject and making me understand that it’s all about how you explain a topic that makes you passionate about it.</p>
    <p>I then enrolled at university, attending the computer science faculty in Bari, and in the meantime with two guys from my own city I founded <a href="https://www.calendbook.com">Calendbook.com</a>, a SaaS for booking online appointments.</p>
    <p>Oh by the way, I haven’t only learned the C language (surprised?), you can take a look at my <a href="https://www.github.com/giacintocarlucci">github</a> to see some of my projects or check my <a href="/docs/skills-and-tools/">skills and tools</a> page.</p>
    <p>Besides programming, I am a hardware enthusiast since the first time I broke my desktop computer (I swear I have improved since then, now I can fix it myself hahaha), I have experimented a lot with Arduino and Atmel chips in general, but I never have time to upload them online as often as I would like, given the longer time it takes. I hope to add some on this site as soon as I can.</p>
    <p><a href="/docs/now/">I am constantly trying to learn new things</a>, which is why I always want to have more time than I actually have.</p>
    <p>When I’m not coding I like to disconnect from digital life and invest my time in analog hobbies such as <a href="/docs/readings/">reading</a> (mainly psychology books) and <a href="/docs/photography">taking pictures with my analog camera</a>.</p>
    <p>If you feel like sharing some thoughts or just want to say hi you can reach me via email:<br />
