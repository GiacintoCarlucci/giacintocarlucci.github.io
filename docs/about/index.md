# About

Hi! I'm Giacinto, a curious guy born in 1996 and living in Italy.
I'm in love with the idea of ​​being able to create virtually
anything from scratch with just a computer since I was a kid.

I started programming in C language (Someone will say the worst 
way to start, someone else will say the best ...) at 13, when my 
dad bought me an Intel Core Duo powered desktop from a shop whose
owner is a man who has repaired my computer many times, because 
I couldn't help but open it up and try to figure out how a 
computer works.

Later, that man became my computer science teacher in high school, 
making me fall in love with the subject and making me understand 
that it's all about how you explain a topic that makes you 
passionate about it.

I then enrolled at university, attending the computer science 
faculty in Bari, and in the meantime with two guys from my own 
city I founded [Calendbook.com](https://www.calendbook.com), a SaaS for booking online appointments.

Oh by the way, I haven't only learned the C language (surprised?), 
you can take a look at my [github](https://www.github.com/giacintocarlucci)
to see some of my projects or check my [skills and tools](/docs/skills-and-tools/)
page.

Besides programming, I am a hardware enthusiast since the first 
time I broke my desktop computer (I swear I have improved since 
then, now I can fix it myself hahaha), I have experimented a lot 
with Arduino and Atmel chips in general, but I never have time 
to upload them online as often as I would like, given the longer 
time it takes. I hope to add some on this site as soon as I can.

[I am constantly trying to learn new things](/docs/now/), which is why I always
want to have more time than I actually have.

When I'm not coding I like to disconnect from digital life and 
invest my time in analog hobbies such as [reading](/docs/readings/)
(mainly psychology books) and 
[taking pictures with my analog camera](/docs/photography).
