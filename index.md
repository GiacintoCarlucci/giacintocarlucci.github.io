**Giacinto Carlucci**: Italian software developer, curious about almost everything.

I tend to keep things as simple as possible, as this means
faster results, smaller changes and easy to understand products.

This website is made using markdown documents and simple bash scripts
to generate HTML pages, so i can easily edit and re-build the
website when some changes are needed. The main purpose is to
inspire *- and being inspired by -* people, sharing my researches,
ideas and works to learn awesome stuff.

[Here's the source code](https://www.github.com/giacintocarlucci/giacintocarlucci.github.io)
for this website.
